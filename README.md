RestCMS

Easy to manage, highly extensible CMS system based on JavaScript and Rest. Thick client, thin server.

The basic idea if this project is: the server manages only the data of the CMS application.
The presentation layer is the HTML webpage only, with thick frontend JavaScript library that
serves the content from the server. The JavaScript RestCMS client contains several components
such as ArticleComponent or MainComponent, that are responsible for managment of the content.

The project is very young, but grows really fast. Just check out our 
<a href="restcms.brejchajan.cz">homepage</a> to see the system in action. Meanwhile we are
building the Docs and How tos for you (in english and czech). We hope it is ready until 
the end of the February.

Stay tuned, the RestCMS is coming.
